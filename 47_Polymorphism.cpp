/*
    Polymorphism
    - one name and multiple forms
    - eg. Function overloading, operator overloading
    - eg. Virtual Functions

    Two types :
    1. Compile time (static or early binding) polymorphism. Can be acheived by -
        - Function Overloading
        - Operator Overloading
    2. Run time (late binding) polymorphism. Can be acheived by -
        - Virtual Functions
