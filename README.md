# NOTES

## 01 - Introduction to C++

- C++ -> 1979 -> Bjarne Stroustrup -> Extension of C
- C++ : fast programs , more control over system resources + memory management
- High performance
- Major updates
    - 2011 -> C++11
    - 2014 -> C++14
    - 2017 -> C++17

## 02 - Variables & Comments in C++

- A variable is a container to hold data.<br> 
Like for storing something we need containers . Now for different types of things we need different container likewise in C++ to store different types of data we have different datatypes in C++. 
> C++ provides a layer of abstraction (from low level to high level) where you can represent your data as int, float, double etc.

- Variable can be of various types. Primarily we have these variable types in C++ :
1. Int - eg. 1,3,2,56,0,...etc.
2. Float - eg. 1.34, 3.54,...etc.
3. Char - eg. 'c', 'd', 'a', 'B' ... etc.
4. Double - it is same as float with more precision. eg. 1.2435 , ... etc.
5. Boolean - True or False.
- int sum = 36; means sum is an integer variable which holds value 36 in memory.

### Syntax for declaring variables in C++

- Data_type Variable_name = Value;
eg. - int a = 4; , char letter = 'a'; , ... etc.
- Based on Scope, variable can be classified into two types:
1. Local Variables
2. Global Variables

### Comments
Used to increase the readability of a program.<br>
For example -
```cpp
// Single Line Comment
```
```cpp
/* 
    Multi-line Comment
*/
```

## 03 - Variable Scope and Data Types in C++

- Scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid.
- Based on scope we have local and global variables in C++
- **Local Variables**: Local variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there.
- **Global Variables**: Global variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.

### C++ Data Types

- Data types define the type of data a **variable** can hold, for example an integer variable can hold integer data, a character type variable can hold character data etc.
- Data types in C++ are categorised in three groups : 
    - Built-in - int, float, char, double, bool.
    - User-defined - struct, union, enum .
    - Derived - array, function, pointer.

### Rules to declare variables in C++

- Variable names in C++ can range from 1 to 255 characters.
- All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_).
- After the first initial letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers.
- Variable names are case sensitive. eg. - means variable 'aman' and 'Aman' are two different things in C++.
- No spaces or special characters are allowed.
- You cannot use a C++ keyword (a reserved word) as a variable name.
